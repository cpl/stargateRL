CODE OF CONDUCT
===============
###### for the `stargateRL community` 

## 1. Purpose
The objective of this document is to act as a blueprint to a safe, welcoming and friendly community where anyone regardless
of gender, race, religion, nationality, culture, disability, social status, etc... (or lack of) is encouraged to contribute
in any way possible (code, spelling, documentation, support, localization, etc...).

In order to maintain a healthy environment, there are **expected** behaviours that should be applied throughout the community 
and **unacceptable** ones that we wish to never see. Those that will not follow the `Code of Conduct` will end up with a
suspension or permanent ban from the project stargateRL and all community related environments. They will also be "displayed" 
on the "wall of shame".

The `Code of Conduct` is expected to be followed on all stargateRL related communities
