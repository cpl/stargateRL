CODE OF CONDUCT
===============
###### for the `stargateRL community` 

## Description

The objective of this document is to act as a blueprint to a safe, welcoming
and friendly community where anyone regardless of gender, race, religion,
nationality, culture, disability, social status, etc... (or lack of) is
encouraged to contribute in any way possible (code, spelling, documentation,
support, localization, etc...).

In order to maintain a healthy environment, there are **expected** behaviours
that should be applied throughout the community and **unacceptable** ones that
we wish to never see. Those that will not follow the `Code of Conduct` will
end up with a suspension or permanent ban from the project stargateRL and all
community related environments. They will also be "displayed" on the "wall of
shame".

The `Code of Conduct` is expected to be
followed on all stargateRL related communities.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at `alexandru.p.copil@gmail.com`. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
